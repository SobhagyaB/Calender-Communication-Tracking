Objective

Our goal is to foster effective professional relationships by maintaining precise records of our communications with other organizations. 
This task involves building a React-based Calendar Application to streamline communication tracking, ensuring timely follow-ups and consistent engagement.

Application Overview

The application will include:

Admin Panel: For setting up organizational details and communication parameters.

User Interface: For managing communication tasks and schedules.

Analytics and Reporting Module (optional): For generating actionable insights.

The design should prioritize user-friendliness, clarity, and efficient data management.
